These points may affect the efficiency in the processing of point cloud, and even influence the accuracy of algorithms. As shown below, it is the point cloud data of a bridge scene. If we are only interested in the bridge body, then the trees and vehicles in the red frame are irrelevant points.</p><p><img src="/2022/01/17/2-point-cloud/irrelevant_points.png" alt="Irrelevant Points"></p></li><li><p><b>Pre-pocessing</b></p><p>The original point cloud is too large and generally not directly used for subsequent processing. Usually, we will first pre-process the data. Pre-processing includes <b>cropping, cutting, cleaning, and downsampling</b> the point cloud, etc.</p><p><img src="/2022/01/17/2-point-cloud/pre-processing.png" alt="Pre-processing"></p></li></ul><p>How to realize these operations?</p><p>One of the commonly used methods is to perform rapid and appropriate processing through existing commercial or free software. This Blog  mainly introduces two commonly used free open source software: <i><b>CloudCompare &amp; MeshLab</b></i></p><h2 id="CloudCompare"><a href="#CloudCompare" class="headerlink" title="CloudCompare"></a>CloudCompare</h2><p>Here are a few small tools:</p><ul><li><p>CloudCompare source code. After we are very familiar with point cloud processing technology, we can write source code here:</p><p>üëâ <a href="https://github.com/cloudcompare/cloudcompare">https://github.com/cloudcompare/cloudcompare</a></p></li><li><p>The following link intuitively introduces the basic operations of CloudCompare in YouTube:</p><p>üëâ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBNUxsUA00UAT63O0d95pByrCjtqlXN4">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBNUxsUA00UAT63O0d95pByrCjtqlXN4</a>_</p></li></ul><p>You can find more detailed operations in <a href="https://github.com/oxon-612/PointCloud_Tutorial/blob/main/Chapter2/Chapter2_zh/%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E7%AB%A0%20%E7%82%B9%E4%BA%91%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6.md">PointCloud_Tutorial Chapter2</a>.</p><h3 id="Bounding-Box"><a href="#Bounding-Box" class="headerlink" title="Bounding Box"></a>Bounding Box</h3><p>The point cloud may have a complicated shape and structure, but no matter how complex the point cloud itself is, its Bounding Box is always a regular and straightforward cuboid. It can help us quickly get the range of the point cloud and facilitate subsequent operations using this range. </p><p>It should be noted that the Bounding Box in CloudComapre is <b>Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB)</b>. In addition to AABB in CloudCompare, there is also a directed Bounding Box, which is called <b>Oriented Bounding Box (OBB)</b>. AABB and OBB are both Bounding Box. What is the difference between them?</p><ul><li><b>Oriented Bounding Box</b> is always aligned with the  principal component direction of the point cloud (PCA can be used to  calculate the principal component direction);</li><li><b>Axis-Aligned Bounding Box</b> is always aligned with the coordinate axis;</li></ul><p><img src="/2022/01/17/2-point-cloud/two_bounding_box.png" alt="Two different bounding boxes"></p><p>Through the above introduction, we can see that OBB is more accurate than AABB to describe the range of point cloud. AABB will frame much invalid space, which will have a particular impact on efficiency in actual algorithm application. When we need a piece of more accurate range information, we generally choose to calculate OBB.</p><h3 id="Cutting"><a href="#Cutting" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Computer Vision is actually to let the computer automatically understand a picture or a scene. </p><p>Putting it in the background of the point cloud means that the computer can understand the point cloud like a human. For the point cloud of a car, people can immediately recognize that it is a car based on their knowledge, and can point out that it has wheels and so on. According to our needs, we can find out <b>the Region of Interest (ROI)</b>, that is, extract a specific point cloud region. ROI varies from situation to situation. It can be a wheel of a car point cloud, a spot on the hood of a car, or some unrelated points next to the vehicle.</p>]]></content>
